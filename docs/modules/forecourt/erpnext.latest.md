## 1. Introduction & Business Context

### 1.1 What Problem Are We Actually Solving?

A petrol station appears simple — buy fuel, sell fuel. Three silent problems can destroy a station financially before management notices.

**Problem 1 — Cash Leakage.** On 17-05-2026 at Shell Maanzoni, cashier Swedi Abuti had expected cash of KES 14,300.70 but declared KES 13,200.00 — a KES 1,100.70 shortage on one shift. Across five cashiers that same shift the total over/under was (KES 983.43). Without a system that reconciles cash collected against fuel dispensed per cashier per shift, these shortfalls remain invisible in aggregate and are never traced to source.

**Problem 2 — Fuel Losses.** With 2,658.43 litres sold on the shift shown (KES 619,312.14 value: Unleaded Extra 955.99 L @ KES 204,785.65 + Diesel Extra 1,702.44 L @ KES 414,526.49), even a 0.3% wetstock loss is 8 litres — KES 1,900 per shift. Annualised: over KES 690,000 in unexplained stock shrinkage.

**Problem 3 — Delivery Fraud.** The supplier docket says 8,000 litres. The before/after dip says 7,796 litres arrived. Without both dip readings, you cannot dispute the docket and the KES 30,600 shortfall goes unrecovered.

### 1.2 The Legacy System: What It Does Well

The existing system already captures all three meter types per nozzle — the `Elect(Cash)`, `Elec(Ltrs)`, and `Man(Ltrs)` columns are visible in the live screen. It also produces a per-cashier Daily Shift Cash Reconciliation Sheet with Invoices, POS, VISA, Receipts, Payments, Expected Cash, Actual Cash, and Over/Under columns per cashier row — exactly the level of accountability needed.

The ERPNext FMS will:
- Replicate the three-meter capture and the per-cashier reconciliation sheet exactly
- Add the wetstock reconciliation (theoretical vs actual dip) that the legacy system handles manually
- Add automated GL journal entries that the legacy system never produces
- Add PTS controller integration for partially automated data capture
- Add EPRA and KRA eTIMS compliance

### 1.3 Real Data Reference — Shell Maanzoni

All examples in this guide use actual Shell Maanzoni data.

**Station configuration:**

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| Products | Unleaded Extra (UX), V-Power (VP), Diesel Extra (DX) |
| EPRA Prices (May 2026) | UX: KES 214.20/L, VP: KES 229.00/L, DX: KES 242.90/L |
| Tanks | T1 (V-Power), T2 (Unleaded), T3 (Diesel) |
| Islands | 4 islands; pumps named UX/DX/VP with island suffix |
| Typical shift | ~2,658 litres, ~KES 619,000 revenue |
| Cashiers per shift | 4–5 cashiers plus supervisor/manager row |

**Observed meter variances from live legacy screen (Elec Vol vs Man Mech):**

| Pump | Elec Ltrs | Man Ltrs | Var (Ltrs) | Var % |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| U5 (Island 3 UX) | 80.99 | 81.00 | −0.00 | 0.01% |
| U6 (Island 3 UX) | 320.56 | 321.00 | −0.43 | 0.13% |
| L5 (Island 3 DX) | 50.24 | 50.00 | +0.23 | **0.46%** → approaching warning |
| L6 (Island 3 DX) | 212.04 | 212.00 | +0.04 | 0.02% |
| U7 (Island 4 UX) | 80.53 | 80.00 | +0.52 | 0.65% → **Warning** |
| U8 (Island 4 UX) | 349.65 | 349.00 | +0.65 | 0.19% |
| L7 (Island 4 DX) | 304.11 | 304.00 | +0.11 | 0.04% |
| L8 (Island 4 DX) | 214.49 | 215.00 | −0.51 | 0.24% |

> Note: U7 at 0.65% exceeds the 0.50% Check B fail threshold. In the ERPNext system this would be flagged as **Fail** and require an Amendment reading or pump inspection before the shift can close.

**Cash reconciliation data — 17-05-2026:**

| Cashier | Sales | Invoices | POS | VISA | Total Credits | Recpts | Pymts | Expected Cash | Actual Cash | Over/(Under) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SWEDI ABUTI | 219,118.70 | 175,168.00 | 5,000.00 | 20,700.00 | 200,868.00 | (1,000.00) | 2,950.00 | 14,300.70 | 13,200.00 | **(1,100.70)** |
| JOEL MUSEMBI | 250.00 | — | — | — | — | 0.00 | — | 250.00 | 250.00 | — |
| ABDIRAHMAN AHM | — | — | — | — | — | 0.00 | 129,295.00 | (129,295.00) | (129,295.00) | — |
| PETER MBEVE | 149,724.50 | 124,021.00 | — | 12,110.00 | 136,131.00 | 0.00 | 410.00 | 13,183.50 | 13,300.00 | **116.50** |
| JOSEPH MATALE | 252,498.23 | 238,349.00 | 11,500.00 | 1,000.00 | 250,849.00 | 0.00 | — | 1,649.23 | 1,650.00 | **0.77** |
| **TOTAL** | **621,591.43** | **537,538.00** | **16,500.00** | **33,810.00** | **587,848.00** | **(1,000.00)** | **132,465.00** | **(99,911.57)** | **(100,895.00)** | **(983.43)** |

> ABDIRAHMAN AHM row represents the manager/supervisor float pool — large Pymts out = safe deposits or float redistribution. The negative Expected Cash in this row is by design (supervisor holds no till; they receive cash from cashiers and deposit to safe).

## 2. The Golden Rules

Every doctype, every field, every validation exists to enforce one of these rules.

**Rule 1 — The Shift Is the Unit of Everything.** A shift is a bounded accountability contract. Every litre dispensed, every shilling collected, every delivery, every dip — all belongs to a shift.

**Rule 2 — Three Meters, One Truth.** Every modern dispensing pump has three independent measurement systems. All three must be read at open and close. Divergence between them is either a data entry error or evidence of tampering.

**Rule 3 — Dip Readings Are the Tank's Bank Statement.** A dip reading measures physical fuel independently of pump meters. It catches meter drift, unrecorded sales, theft, and leaks.

**Rule 4 — Cash and Fuel Reconcile Separately.** Cash: did each cashier collect the right amount? Wetstock: did the right volume leave the tanks? Computed independently; never merged.

**Rule 5 — No Opening Reading, No Sales.** Sales cannot begin before all three opening meter readings are captured per nozzle.

**Rule 6 — Deliveries Need Before and After Dips.** Never accept a delivery on docket volume alone.

**Rule 7 — Dual Control on All Cash Movements.** Float, pickup, safe drop — two people, two user accounts, every time.

**Rule 8 — Each Cashier Reconciles Independently.** The cash formula runs per Cashier Session, matching the current paper reconciliation sheet row by row.

---

## 3. The Three Meter Types — Core Concept

This is the foundation of all wetstock integrity and fraud detection. The legacy system already captures all three types. The ERPNext system replicates this exactly.

### 3.1 Physical Layout

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    DISPENSING PUMP                      │
│                                                         │
│  ┌──────────────────┐   ┌────────────────────────┐     │
│  │  DIGITAL DISPLAY  │   │  MECHANICAL DRUMS       │     │
│  │  Vol: 171,275,183 │   │  (Physical Number Wheels│     │
│  │  Cash: 29,387,277 │   │   — no power needed)    │     │
│  └──────────────────┘   └────────────────────────┘     │
│   Electronic Vol + Cash    Manual Mechanical             │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 3.2 Type 1 — Electronic Volume (Elec Vol)

Cumulative digital counter: total litres dispensed since installation. The primary legal measurement.

- Counts forward only; never resets; sealed by Weights & Measures
- 3 decimal places: e.g. 171,275,183.070 (actual UX8 totalizer at Shell Maanzoni)
- Primary figure used in all wetstock and sales calculations

`Elec Vol Sold = Closing Elec Vol − Opening Elec Vol`

### 3.3 Type 2 — Electronic Cash (Elec Cash)

Cumulative KES value of fuel dispensed — mathematically linked to Elec Vol via the programmed EPRA price.

`Elec Cash Sold = Closing Elec Cash − Opening Elec Cash`

**Cross-check (same-rate shift):**
```
Expected Cash = Elec Vol Sold × EPRA Rate
Discrepancy = |Elec Cash Sold − Expected Cash|

Shell Maanzoni 17-05-2026 example:
  U7 Island 4: 80.53 L × 214.20 = KES 17,249.63 expected
               Legacy shows KES 17,248.46 → discrepancy KES 1.17 → Pass ✓
  U8 Island 4: 349.65 L × 214.20 = KES 74,895.03 expected
               Legacy shows KES 74,895.24 → discrepancy KES 0.21 → Pass ✓
```

Why store this if we can compute it? Because it is a **physically independent sensor inside the pump**. If someone miskeys the Elec Vol reading, the Cash meter immediately exposes the discrepancy.

### 3.4 Type 3 — Manual Mechanical (Man Mech)

Physical odometer-style counter — rotating drums driven by the flow mechanism. Completely independent of electronics; requires no power; cannot be reset without a KEBS physical key.

Less precise (0.1 L vs 0.001 L for electronic), but immune to electronic tampering. Last line of defence when tampering is suspected.

`Mech Vol Sold = Closing Man Mech − Opening Man Mech`  
Must be within 0.5% of Elec Vol Sold. Above 1.0%: lock pump, notify KEBS.

### 3.5 Summary Table

| Attribute | Elec Vol | Elec Cash | Man Mech |
|---|---|---|---|
| Display | Digital screen | Digital screen | Physical number wheels |
| Unit | Litres | KES | Litres |
| Precision | 0.001 L | KES 0.01 | 0.1 L |
| Power required | Yes | Yes | No |
| Primary use | Volume sold | Cash cross-check | Tampering detection |

## 4. Cross-Validation

### 4.1 The Four-Way Check

At shift close, four independent data sources must agree about how much fuel was sold:

```
                   ┌────────────────────┐
                   │   DIP READING (L)  │  ← Physical reality in tank
                   └─────────┬──────────┘
                             │ must agree with
             ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
   ┌──────────▼──┐  ┌─────────▼────┐  ┌──────▼──────────┐
   │ Elec Vol    │  │ Elec Cash    │  │ Man Mech        │
   │ (L)         │  │ ÷ Rate = (L) │  │ (L)             │
   └─────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └─────────────────┘
         └────────────────┴────────────────────┘
                  All must agree within tolerance
```

### 4.2 Check A — Volume vs Cash (per nozzle)

```python
discrepancy = abs(elec_cash_sold - (elec_vol_sold * shift_rate))
# Pass: ≤ KES 5    Warning: KES 5–20    Fail: > KES 20
```

### 4.3 Check B — Volume vs Mechanical (per nozzle)

```python
divergence_pct = abs(elec_vol_sold - mech_vol_sold) / elec_vol_sold * 100
# Pass: ≤ 0.30%   Warning: 0.30–0.50%   Fail: 0.50–1.00%   Critical > 1.00% → lock pump
```

**Applying this to the live Shell Maanzoni data:**

| Pump | Elec | Mech | Divergence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| U7 | 80.53 | 80.00 | 0.65% | **Fail** — requires Amendment or inspection |
| L5 | 50.24 | 50.00 | 0.48% | **Warning** — schedule calibration |
| U8 | 349.65 | 349.00 | 0.19% | Pass ✓ |
| L8 | 214.49 | 215.00 | 0.24% | Pass ✓ |

### 4.4 Check D — Tank Wetstock

```
Theoretical Closing = Opening Dip + Deliveries − Tank Elec Vol Sold
Wetstock Variance   = Theoretical − Actual Closing Dip
```

### 4.5 Check E — Elec Cash vs POS Invoices (per shift)

```
Σ POS Invoice amounts per nozzle ≈ Elec Cash Sold per nozzle
Tolerance: ≤ KES 10.00 per nozzle
```

## 5. Architecture Overview

### 5.1 Design Principles

1. One source of truth per concept — shift date on Shift; not repeated on children.
2. Three meter types, one Meter Reading doctype — `meter_type` is a field, not separate doctypes.
3. Per-cashier accountability — cash formula runs per Cashier Session, not per shift.
4. Extend native doctypes, never replace — FMS adds fields and hooks to GRN, POS Invoice, Stock Entry.
5. Company field on every FMS document — User Permission cascades automatically.
6. Frappe inside bench — PTS integration lives inside the Frappe app.

## 6. ERPNext Foundation Setup

### 6.1 Company Hierarchy

```
Shell Kenya Limited                (Parent)
├── Shell Maanzoni (Anika Global)  (Sub-company)
├── Shell Mombasa Road
└── Shell Westlands
```

### 6.2 Chart of Accounts

**Income (parent: Sales)**

| Account | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Fuel Sales — PMS Unleaded (UX) | Unleaded Extra revenue |
| Fuel Sales — PMS V-Power (VP) | V-Power revenue (separate — different EPRA price) |
| Fuel Sales — AGO Diesel (DX) | Diesel Extra revenue |
| Fuel Sales — DPK | Kerosene revenue |

**COGS**

| Account | Purpose |
|---|---|
| COGS — Fuel PMS Unleaded | Cost of UX sold |
| COGS — Fuel PMS V-Power | Cost of VP sold |
| COGS — Fuel AGO Diesel | Cost of DX sold |
| Wetstock Variance — PMS | Petrol losses |
| Wetstock Variance — AGO | Diesel losses |
| Cash Short / Over | Cashier variances (per-cashier posting) |
| Drive-Off Losses | Fuel dispensed, not paid |

**Assets**

| Account | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Fuel Inventory — PMS Unleaded | Physical UX in Tank 2 |
| Fuel Inventory — PMS V-Power | Physical VP in Tank 1 |
| Fuel Inventory — AGO Diesel | Physical DX in Tank 3 |
| MPesa Clearing | MPesa collections |
| Card Payment Clearing | VISA/card settlements |
| Fleet Card Clearing | Shell/fleet card |
| Safe — Main | Site safe balance |
| Till — Active | Active cashier till |

### 6.3 Fuel Grade Items

> **Critical:** Keep V-Power and Unleaded as **separate ERPNext Items** — different EPRA price schedule, different revenue accounts, potentially different WAC from different depot batches.

| Field | FUEL-PMS-UNL | FUEL-PMS-VP | FUEL-AGO |
|---|---|---|---|
| Item Code | `FUEL-PMS-UNL` | `FUEL-PMS-VP` | `FUEL-AGO` |
| UOM | Litre | Litre | Litre |
| Valuation | Moving Average (WAC) | Moving Average (WAC) | Moving Average (WAC) |
| Selling Rate | 214.20 | 229.00 | 242.90 |
| Default Warehouse | Tank 2 — Unleaded | Tank 1 — V-Power | Tank 3 — Diesel |

**Why WAC?** Each delivery arrives at a slightly different cost. WAC blends automatically. This is the only correct valuation for bulk liquid fuel.

**Custom fields on Item:** `fms_is_fuel_product` (Check), `fms_fuel_grade` (Select: UX/VP/DX/DPK).

### 6.4 Tank Warehouses — Shell Maanzoni

| Warehouse | Product | Nozzle type on pumps |
|---|---|---|
| Tank 1 — V-Power | FUEL-PMS-VP | VP / P nozzles |
| Tank 2 — Unleaded | FUEL-PMS-UNL | UX / U nozzles |
| Tank 3 — Diesel | FUEL-AGO | DX / L nozzles |

**Custom fields on Warehouse:** `fms_is_fuel_tank` (Check), `fms_capacity_litres` (Float), `fms_pts2_tank_number` (Int).

### 6.5 User Roles

| Role | Access | Permissions |
|---|---|---|
| Shell HQ Manager | All companies | Read/Write all, all sites |
| Shell HQ Auditor | All companies | Read-only, all sites |
| Site Manager | Own company | Full access; approve variances; post GL |
| Site Supervisor | Own company | Open/close shifts; authorise cash events |
| Site Cashier | Own company | Own sessions, POS, cash events |
| Pump Attendant | Own company | Meter readings, dip readings |

### 6.6 User Permissions

For every site-level user: one User Permission record, `Document Type: Company`, `Value: Shell Maanzoni`, `Apply to All Doctypes: ✅`.

HQ Manager and HQ Auditor have no User Permission records — unrestricted access is the absence of a restriction.

### 6.7 Forecourt Site Preferences (Single Doctype)

Per-station configuration so variance thresholds and account names are configurable without touching Python.

| Field | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `company` | — | Name field — one record per company |
| `default_fuel_supplier` | — | Auto-populate on GRN |
| `wetstock_normal_pct` | 0.30 | Normal tolerance % |
| `wetstock_elevated_pct` | 0.50 | Elevated tolerance % |
| `cash_normal_kes` | 50 | Normal cash variance |
| `cash_elevated_kes` | 200 | Elevated cash variance |
| `meter_check_a_warn_kes` | 5 | Check A warning threshold |
| `meter_check_b_warn_pct` | 0.30 | Check B warning % |
| `meter_check_b_fail_pct` | 0.50 | Check B fail % |
| `meter_check_b_tamper_pct` | 1.00 | Lock pump threshold |
| `cash_pickup_threshold` | 30,000 | Till threshold for pickup |

### 7.3 Shift (Master Record)

**Status state machine — new `Readings Captured` state gates the shift:**

```
Draft → Open → Readings Captured → Closing → Closed
                      ↓                ↓
                  Disputed ←──────────→ Closing  (manager re-opens)
```

`Readings Captured` means all three opening meter readings for all active nozzles have been submitted. Without it, a shift could move to Closing with incomplete readings.

| Field | Type | Notes |

| `opened_at` | Datetime | |
| `closed_at` | Datetime | |
| `cashier` | Link → Employee | Primary cashier |
| `supervisor` | Link → Employee | Must differ from cashier |

### 7.4 Meter Reading (Three Types, One Doctype)

The `meter_type` field is the differentiator — not separate doctypes.

**Immutability:** Once submitted, `totalizer_value` cannot be changed. To correct: create an `Amendment` reading. The original remains as evidence.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Auto | e.g. `MR-2026-0001` |
| `shift` | Link → Shift | |
| `pump` | Link → Pump | |
| `nozzle_number` | Int | Which nozzle on this pump |
| **`meter_type`** | **Select** | **Electronic Volume / Electronic Cash / Manual Mechanical** |
| `reading_position` | Select | Shift Open / Shift Close / Spot Check / Amendment |
| `observed_at` | Datetime | |
| `totalizer_value` | Float | Raw number from display or wheels |
| `unit` | Select | Auto-set: Litres (Elec Vol / Man Mech) or KES (Elec Cash) |
| `read_by` | Link → Employee | Who physically read the meter |
| `witnessed_by` | Link → Employee | Supervisor or second attendant |
| `notes` | Text | Unusual observations (flickering display, etc.) |
| `superseded_by` | Link → Meter Reading | Set when corrected by Amendment |
| `amendment_reason` | Text | Required if `reading_position = Amendment` |

```python
# fms/doctype/meter_reading/meter_reading.py
def validate(doc, method):
    doc.unit = "KES" if doc.meter_type == "Electronic Cash" else "Litres"
    if frappe.utils.flt(doc.totalizer_value) <= 0:
        frappe.throw("Totalizer value must be greater than zero.")
    if doc.reading_position == "Shift Close":
        opening = frappe.db.get_value("Meter Reading", {

            "nozzle_number": doc.nozzle_number, "meter_type": doc.meter_type,
            "reading_position": "Shift Open", "docstatus": 1
        }, "totalizer_value")
        if opening is None:
            frappe.throw(f"No Shift Open reading for {doc.pump} / N{doc.nozzle_number} / {doc.meter_type}.")
        if frappe.utils.flt(doc.totalizer_value) < frappe.utils.flt(opening):
            frappe.throw(f"Closing ({doc.totalizer_value}) < opening ({opening}). Meters only count forward.")
    # Immutability on submitted records
    if doc.docstatus == 1:
        old_val = frappe.db.get_value("Meter Reading", doc.name, "totalizer_value")
        if old_val is not None and frappe.utils.flt(old_val) != frappe.utils.flt(doc.totalizer_value):
            frappe.throw(f"Submitted Meter Reading {doc.name} is immutable. Create an Amendment instead.")
    if doc.reading_position == "Amendment" and not doc.amendment_reason:
        frappe.throw("Amendment readings require an Amendment Reason.")
```

### 7.5 Meter Validation Result

Computed output of Check A and Check B per nozzle. Auto-generated; never manually edited.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `shift` | Link → Shift | |
| `pump` | Link → Pump | |

**Meter validation Python engine:**

```python
# fms/utils/meter.py

CHECK_A_PASS_KES   = 5.0
CHECK_A_WARN_KES   = 20.0
CHECK_B_PASS_PCT   = 0.30
CHECK_B_WARN_PCT   = 0.50
CHECK_B_TAMPER_PCT = 1.00

def _validate_nozzle(nd, shift):
    rate = _get_rate(shift, nd.fuel_product)
    elec_vol  = frappe.utils.flt(nd.elec_vol_sold)
    elec_cash = frappe.utils.flt(nd.elec_cash_sold)
    mech_vol  = frappe.utils.flt(nd.mech_vol_sold)

    expected_cash  = elec_vol * rate
    check_a_disc   = abs(elec_cash - expected_cash)
    check_b_pct    = abs(elec_vol - mech_vol) / elec_vol * 100 if elec_vol else 0.0

    check_a = "Pass" if check_a_disc <= CHECK_A_PASS_KES else (
              "Warning" if check_a_disc <= CHECK_A_WARN_KES else "Fail")

              "Critical" if check_b_pct > CHECK_B_TAMPER_PCT else "Fail"))

    severity = {"Pass": 0, "Warning": 1, "Fail": 2, "Critical": 3}
    overall  = max(check_a, check_b, key=lambda s: severity[s])

    if check_b == "Critical":
        _lock_pump(nd.pump)

    return {
        "pump": nd.pump, "nozzle_number": nd.nozzle_number,

    frappe.publish_realtime("pump_locked", {"pump": pump_name,
        "reason": "Meter Check B Critical — possible tampering"})
```

### 7.6 Tank Dip Reading

Single doctype for all scenarios. `reading_type` and `reading_source` differentiate them.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `shift` | Link → Shift | |
| `company` | Link → Company | |
| `tank` | Link → Warehouse | |
| `reading_datetime` | Datetime | |
| `reading_type` | Select | Shift Open / Shift Close / Delivery Before / Delivery After / Spot |
| `reading_source` | Select | Manual Dipstick / ATG Electronic |
| `dip_height_mm` | Float | Raw dipstick measurement |
| `volume_observed_l` | Float | From ATG or derived via calibration chart |
| `water_level_mm` | Float | Alert threshold: 20mm |
| `calibration_chart` | Link → Tank Calibration Chart | Required for manual |
| `read_by` | Link → Employee | |

Validation: volume ≤ tank capacity; water > 20mm raises alert; Delivery After dip ≥ 10 minutes after delivery end.

### 7.7 Tank Calibration Chart

Converts dip height (mm) to volume (litres) via EPRA-certified strapping table.

```python
def derive_volume_from_dip(dip_height_mm, chart_name):
    chart = frappe.get_doc("Tank Calibration Chart", chart_name)
    rows = sorted(chart.chart_readings, key=lambda r: r.dip_height_mm)
    if dip_height_mm < rows[0].dip_height_mm or dip_height_mm > rows[-1].dip_height_mm:
        frappe.throw(f"Dip {dip_height_mm}mm is outside calibration chart range.")
    for i in range(len(rows) - 1):
        lo, hi = rows[i], rows[i + 1]
        if lo.dip_height_mm <= dip_height_mm <= hi.dip_height_mm:
            ratio = (dip_height_mm - lo.dip_height_mm) / (hi.dip_height_mm - lo.dip_height_mm)
            return lo.volume_ltrs + ratio * (hi.volume_ltrs - lo.volume_ltrs)
```

### 7.8 Cashier Session

One session per cashier per shift. Multiple sessions per shift are normal at Shell Maanzoni (4–5 per shift). Each cashier reconciles independently — matching the paper Cash Reconciliation Sheet.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `shift` | Link → Shift | |
| `cashier` | Link → Employee | |
| `till_id` | Data | e.g. "TILL-01" |
| `is_primary` | Check | First cashier of the shift |
| `float_amount` | Currency | Opening float |
| `actual_cash_close` | Currency | Physically counted |
| `counted_by` | Link → Employee | The cashier |
| `verified_by` | Link → Employee | Supervisor (different person) |

### 7.9 Cash Event

Every cash movement: float, pickup, payout, safe drop.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `shift` | Link → Shift | |
| `cashier_session` | Link → Cashier Session | Active session |
| `event_type` | Select | Float Issued / Cash Pickup / Payout / Safe Drop |
| `amount` | Currency | |
| `authorised_by` | Link → Employee | Must differ from session cashier |
| `occurred_at` | Datetime | |
| `reference` | Data | Envelope number — required for Pickup/Safe Drop |

### 7.10 Shift Reconciliation

Computed summary. Fix source data, then recompute.

**Child Table 1 — Per-Cashier Cash Summaries** (replicates paper Cash Reconciliation Sheet exactly):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `cashier` | Link → Employee | |
| `cashier_session` | Link → Cashier Session | |
| `sales` | Currency | Total sales billed to this cashier |
| `invoices` | Currency | Credit invoices — non-cash, deducted |
| `pos_payments` | Currency | POS/mobile money — non-cash, deducted |
| `visa_card` | Currency | VISA/card — non-cash, deducted |
| `total_credits` | Currency | `invoices + pos_payments + visa_card` |
| `receipts` | Currency | Adjustments in (negative = out) |
| `payments_out` | Currency | Cash pickups and safe drops |
| `expected_cash` | Currency | `sales − total_credits + receipts − payments_out` |
| `actual_cash` | Currency | Physically counted |
| `cash_over_under` | Currency | `actual − expected` |

**Cash formula — verified against 17-05-2026 paper sheet:**
```
Swedi Abuti:   219,118.70 − 200,868.00 + (−1,000.00) − 2,950.00 = 14,300.70 ✓
Peter Mbeve:   149,724.50 − 136,131.00 + 0 − 410.00 = 13,183.50 ✓
Joseph Matale: 252,498.23 − 250,849.00 + 0 − 0 = 1,649.23 ✓
```

**Child Table 2 — Tank Wetstock Summaries:**

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tank` | Link → Warehouse | |
| `fuel_product` | Link → Item | |
| `opening_stock_l` | Float | From Shift Open dip |
| `deliveries_l` | Float | From accepted Fuel Delivery Dips |
| `elec_vol_sales_l` | Float | Σ Elec Vol for all nozzles on this tank |
| `mech_vol_sales_l` | Float | Σ Man Mech (cross-check) |
| `theoretical_closing_l` | Float | Opening + Deliveries − Sales |
| `actual_closing_l` | Float | From Shift Close dip |
| `variance_l` | Float | Theoretical − Actual |
| `variance_pct` | Float | |
| `classification` | Select | Normal / Elevated / Critical / Gain |
| `variance_kes` | Currency | `variance_l × WAC` |

|---|---|---|
| `pump` | Link → Pump | |
| `nozzle` | Int | |
| `elec_vol_sold` | Float | |
| `elec_cash_sold` | Currency | |
| `mech_vol_sold` | Float | |
| `check_a_status` | Select | Pass / Warning / Fail |
| `check_b_status` | Select | Pass / Warning / Fail / Critical |

### 7.11 Other Key Doctypes

**Fuel Delivery Dip** — links Purchase Receipt to before/after dip readings; tracks truck reg, docket number, dip-measured vs docket variance; Accepted / Disputed status.

**Drive-Off Record** — fuel dispensed but not paid; auto-computes KES from volume × shift rate; requires manager authorisation; police reference required if ≥ KES 500; on submit posts `DR Drive-Off Losses / CR Fuel Sales`.

**Forecourt Transaction** — PTS staging record; every PTS pump sale lands here before becoming a POS/Sales Invoice at shift close; `pts_transaction_number` is the deduplication key.

**Fuel Price History** — tracks every EPRA price change; `approved_by` required if new price exceeds EPRA cap; triggers WebSocket push to PTS controllers on submit.

**PTS-2 Device Registry** — maps hardware `device_id` to ERPNext company; `last_seen` updated on every push.

**Pump Configuration** — maps `pts_pump_id` hardware to ERPNext Pump record with JSON fuel grade and tank mappings.

**Fleet Card** — card number, customer, grade restriction, credit limit, volume/amount limit per fill, RFID tag ID for PTS-2 authorisation.

## 11. Shift Lifecycle & Cash Reconciliation

### 11.1 Opening a Shift

1. Supervisor creates `Shift → New`: company, date, label, cashier, supervisor
2. Lock EPRA rates: `rate_pms_unl = 214.20`, `rate_pms_vp = 229.00`, `rate_ago = 242.90`
3. Create `Cashier Session` for each cashier; issue floats → `Cash Event: Float Issued`
4. Opening dips for every active tank → `Tank Dip Reading: Shift Open`
5. Opening meter readings for every active nozzle — **all three types each**:
   - Electronic Volume (L) — from digital display
   - Electronic Cash (KES) — from digital display
   - Manual Mechanical (L) — from number wheels
6. Once all opening readings submitted → transition to `Readings Captured`
7. Status → `Open` — sales can begin

### 11.2 During the Shift

- All POS sales: correct payment method and named pump attendant (never blank/N/A)
- Fleet/credit sales → Sales Invoice (not POS) — these populate the `Invoices` column in reconciliation
- Cash pickup when till > KES 30,000: `Cash Event: Cash Pickup` + supervisor sign + envelope number — populates `Pymts` column
- Fuel delivery: Section 12
- Drive-off: `Drive-Off Record` with manager authorisation
- If second cashier takes over: new `Cashier Session`, not a new Shift

### 11.3 Closing a Shift

1. Read all pump displays — enter **all three closing meter readings** per nozzle
2. Take closing dips for all active tanks
3. Each cashier physically counts till and enters `actual_cash_close` in their Cashier Session
4. Enter non-cash totals per cashier: Invoices (credit sales), POS (mobile money), VISA (card)
5. Status → `Closing`
6. Supervisor runs "Run Meter Validation" → `Meter Validation Result` per nozzle
7. Resolve any Check B Fail/Critical (Amendment reading or pump inspection) and re-run
8. Supervisor runs "Compute Reconciliation" → `Shift Reconciliation` document created
9. Review per-cashier summaries (matches the paper Cash Rec Sheet)
10. Review per-tank wetstock summaries
11. If all balanced → Approve → Post GL Journal → Status → `Closed`
12. If Critical variance → Status → `Disputed` → investigate before GL

## 12. Fuel Delivery (GRN) Workflow

### 12.1 Delivery Variance Formula

```
received_qty = (dip_after − dip_before) + sales_during_offload
variance     = expected_qty − received_qty
```

Positive variance = supplier delivered less than docket. Negative = excess (rare, also investigate).

### 12.2 Workflow

1. Truck arrives → record truck reg, driver, docket number, fuel product, docket volume
2. `Tank Dip Reading → Delivery Before`
3. Offloading begins; normal dispensing continues
4. Offloading ends → wait 10–15 minutes for fuel to settle
5. `Tank Dip Reading → Delivery After`
6. System computes `dip_measured = after − before`
7. For PTS sites: `sales_during_offload` auto-calculated; for manual: read pump meters before/after offload
8. If `|variance| ≤ 0.5%`: Accept → raise Purchase Receipt at dip volume
9. If `|variance| > 0.5%`: Dispute → call supplier with dip evidence → do not post GRN until resolved

### 13.2 Variance Classification

| Metric | Normal (Auto-Approve) | Elevated (Review) | Critical (Block) |

| Wetstock gain % | — | Any > 0.3% | — (always flag) |
| Cash variance (KES) | ≤ 50 | 50–200 | > 200 |
| Check A discrepancy | ≤ KES 5 | KES 5–20 | > KES 20 |
| Check B divergence | ≤ 0.30% | 0.30–0.50% | > 0.50%; > 1.0% = lock pump |

### 13.3 Meter-Based Theft Detection

The legacy system shows `Var(Ltrs)` (Elec Vol − Man Mech). ERPNext adds a further check: comparing the pump totalizer increment against billed POS/Sales Invoice volumes per nozzle. If a pump's totalizer shows 350 litres dispensed but only 320 litres appear in invoices for that nozzle, 30 litres were dispensed without being billed — fraud by a specific attendant.

---

## 14. Fleet Cards & Credit Customers

**Fleet Card doctype:** card number, customer, grade restriction, credit limit, volume/amount limit per fill, RFID tag for PTS-2 authorisation, expiry date.

**Authorisation flow (PTS-2):** Driver presents card → PTS-2 reads RFID → FMS checks active/limit/grade → `AuthorizePump` back to PTS-2 → pump unlocks → Forecourt Transaction with `payment_mode = Fleet Card` → Sales Invoice at shift close.

**Monthly cycle:** Sales Invoices for credit customers at shift close → monthly statement → Payment Entry clears AR.

---

## 15. Kenya Compliance

**VAT (16%):** Create tax template `Kenya Fuel VAT 16%`, rate 16%, account `VAT Payable`. Apply to all POS Profiles and Sales Invoice defaults.

**Excise Duty:** Embedded in supplier invoice price. Model as Landed Cost on GRN — after submitting Purchase Receipt, create `Landed Cost Voucher` and add excise component. ERPNext adjusts WAC upward.

**eTIMS Integration:** On POS Invoice and Sales Invoice `on_submit`, POST to KRA eTIMS API. Store returned invoice number and QR code. Log failures but do not block invoice submission — flag for manual retry.

**EPRA Price Cap Validation:** On `Fuel Price History.validate`, if `new_price > epra_max_price` and `approved_by` is empty, throw. If approved, allow with warning.

---

## 16. Security & Data Isolation

**ERPNext User Permissions** on `Company` filter all list views, reports, and forms.  
**FMS Company field** on every doctype — PTS receivers set it from the device registry.

> **Critical for SQL reports:** User Permissions do not filter raw Query Reports. Every custom FMS SQL report must include `WHERE company IN %(companies)s`.

**PTS-2 HMAC:** `hmac.compare_digest()` (constant-time) prevents timing attacks.

### Role Permission Matrix

| DocType | HQ Mgr | HQ Audit | Site Mgr | Supervisor | Cashier |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shift | RW/C/S | R | RW/C/S | RW/C/S | R |
| Meter Reading | RW/C/S/Amend | R | RW/C/S | RW/C/S | R |
| Cash Event | RW/C/S/Cancel | R | RW/C/S | RW/C/S | Create |
| Shift Reconciliation | RW | R | RW | R | — |
| Drive-Off Record | RW/C/S | R | RW/C/S | RW/C/S | R |
| Forecourt Site Prefs | RW | R | RW | R | — |

---

## 17. Offline Resilience & Error Handling

**PTS-2 offline:** Records queued on SD card; replayed on reconnect. Deduplication on `pts_transaction_number` handles bulk replay. SD card logging must be enabled in PTS-2 Parameters.

**Generic PTS offline buffer:** Transactions written to `/tmp/fms_pts_buffer.json` when ERPNext is unreachable; replayed via `fms.api.offline_buffer.replay`.

**Shift close without PTS:** Attendants read pump displays manually; enter closing totalizers; proceed normally.

**Duplicate prevention:** `pts_transaction_number` dedup key — duplicate inserts return `{"status": "ok"}` silently, not a 500 error.

## 19. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — ERPNext Foundation (Weeks 1–2)

- [ ] Install ERPNext v15; create Shell Kenya Limited + Shell Maanzoni sub-company
- [ ] Create Chart of Accounts with V-Power accounts separate from Unleaded
- [ ] Create Items: `FUEL-PMS-UNL`, `FUEL-PMS-VP`, `FUEL-AGO`
- [ ] Create tank Warehouses: Tank 1 (V-Power), Tank 2 (Unleaded), Tank 3 (Diesel)
- [ ] Create Roles; configure User Permissions
- [ ] Configure POS Profiles, Payment Methods, Kenya Fuel VAT 16%
- [ ] Create Employee records: Swedi Abuti, Peter Mbeve, Joseph Matale, Shadrack Kimulu, James Kitiapi, Joel Musembi, Abdirahman, etc.
- [ ] Create Supplier records for depots and transporters

### Phase 2 — FMS App & Manual Workflow (Weeks 3–4)

- [ ] `bench new-app fms`; `pip install pyserial pymodbus websocket-client --break-system-packages`
- [ ] Create all FMS doctypes including three-meter Meter Reading and Meter Validation Result
- [ ] Create Drive-Off Record, Forecourt Site Preferences, and all other doctypes
- [ ] Define custom fields via fixtures; `bench migrate`
- [ ] Configure Forecourt Site Preferences for Maanzoni
- [ ] Create Pump and Nozzle records matching actual hardware (UX/DX/VP pumps per island)
- [ ] Enter tank calibration charts for all three tanks
- [ ] Test full manual workflow: open shift → 3 meter readings per nozzle → dips → 5-cashier close → GL
- [ ] Verify per-cashier reconciliation matches paper sheet with 17-05-2026 data
- [ ] Configure eTIMS with KRA test environment

### Phase 3 — PTS Integration (Weeks 5–6)

- [ ] Order PTS-2 SDK from Technotrade; implement receiver against SDK simulator
- [ ] Create PTS-2 Device registry; create Pump Configuration mappings for all pumps
- [ ] Configure Nginx WebSocket proxy; configure PTS-2 at Maanzoni with server domain and secret key
- [ ] Test all data flows: pump transactions, tank measurements, alerts, price push, RFID sync
- [ ] Run 2-week parallel operation (paper + FMS) before cutting over

### Phase 4 — Multi-Site Rollout (Ongoing)

- [ ] Repeat Phases 1–3 for each additional site; HQ cross-site dashboard; train HQ Auditors
- [ ] Go-live site by site; 2-week parallel run per site

### Migration from Legacy System

1. Physical dip at cutover → `Stock Entry (Material Receipt)` for opening balances
2. Keep legacy read-only for 12 months; do not migrate history
3. Last shift on legacy, first shift on FMS — same calendar day
4. If FMS fails mid-shift: revert to paper dockets; reconcile retrospectively

### 20.4 UAT Checklist (Per Site Go-Live)

```
Manual workflow:
□  Shift blocks sales until all three opening meter readings submitted per nozzle
□  Three types all required — cannot move to Readings Captured if any missing
□  Calibration chart interpolation: correct volume from dip height
□  5-cashier shift: each reconciles independently
□  Cash formula verified against 17-05-2026 paper sheet:
     □  Swedi Abuti:   expected 14,300.70 ✓
     □  Peter Mbeve:   expected 13,183.50 ✓
     □  Joseph Matale: expected 1,649.23 ✓
□  Check B: U7 at 0.65% → Fail; pump at 1.5% → Critical + locked
□  GL journal posts and balances (DR = CR within KES 0.05)
□  Drive-off: DR Drive-Off Losses / CR Fuel Sales — correct amounts
□  Delivery variance > 0.5% blocks GRN submission without approval

PTS-2 workflow:
□  Pump transaction appears within 30 seconds of dispense
□  Duplicate transaction (PTS retry) silently skipped
□  Tank measurement updates on ATG level change
□  Alert fires on probe disconnect
□  Price push reaches pump display within 5 seconds of save
□  RFID sync updates tag list on PTS-2
□  Reconnect after 8-hour offline: all records land, no duplicates

Kenya compliance:
□  VAT 16% calculated correctly on POS Invoice
□  eTIMS number returned and stored after submit
□  Price above EPRA cap blocked without approval
```

---

## 21. Known Limitations

**Sub-100ms pump authorisation.** Frappe's 50–200ms latency is fine for shift reconciliation but not for prepay flows. Use PTS-2's local OPT integration for prepay.

**Custom SQL reports.** User Permissions don't filter raw Query Reports. Every FMS SQL report must include an explicit company filter.

**WAC and delivery variance.** Purchase Invoice must match GRN received quantity, not docket quantity, to keep WAC consistent.

**N/A attendant.** The legacy system accepts blank/N/A attendants. ERPNext FMS blocks POS Invoice submission without a valid `fms_pump_attendant`. This is intentional — the legacy gap is eliminated.

**ERPNext upgrade risk.** Custom fields survive upgrades as Frappe Custom Field records. Always test `bench update` on staging before production.

**WebSocket stability.** Short-lived connections per command. Adequate for typical price update frequencies; persistent pool needed for 50+ simultaneous sites.

---

## 22. Appendix

### A. Daily Operating Checklist

**Shift Opening (Incoming Cashier + Supervisor):**
```
□  Previous shift = Closed (or Disputed with explanation)
□  Create Forecourt Shift: date, label, cashier(s), supervisor, EPRA rates locked
□  Create Cashier Session(s); issue floats → Cash Event: Float Issued (supervisor signs)
□  Opening dip — EVERY active tank:
     □  Tank 1 (V-Power)  □  Tank 2 (Unleaded)  □  Tank 3 (Diesel)
     □  Water levels — alert if > 20mm
□  Opening meter readings — EVERY active nozzle, ALL THREE TYPES:
     □  UX pumps: Elec Vol / Elec Cash / Man Mech
     □  DX pumps: Elec Vol / Elec Cash / Man Mech
     □  VP pumps: Elec Vol / Elec Cash / Man Mech
□  Transition → Readings Captured → Open
□  Brief attendants: do not dispense until system shows Open
```

**During the Shift:**
```
□  All POS: correct payment method + named attendant (never N/A or blank)
□  Fleet/credit → Sales Invoice (not POS) — this feeds Invoices column in cash rec
□  Till > KES 30,000: Cash Pickup + supervisor sign + envelope no. → Pymts column
□  Fuel delivery: Dip Before → wait 15 min → Dip After → GRN
□  Drive-off: Drive-Off Record with manager authorisation
```

**Shift Closing (Cashier + Supervisor):**
```
□  Each cashier physically counts till
□  Closing meter readings — EVERY active nozzle, ALL THREE TYPES
□  Closing dip — every active tank
□  Each cashier enters actual cash count in Cashier Session
□  Enter non-cash totals per cashier: Invoices / POS / VISA (matching paper sheet columns)
□  Status → Closing
□  Run Meter Validation → resolve any Check B Fail/Critical
□  Compute Reconciliation → review per-cashier summaries + wetstock
□  If balanced: Approve → Post GL → Status → Closed
□  If Critical: Status → Disputed → investigate
□  Brief incoming shift
```

## 23. Architectural Corrections — Shift as Metadata

### 23.1 The Critical Principle

**A Shift does not record actual transactions.** It is a coordination and accountability framework. All actual financial, inventory, and purchasing events live exclusively in ERPNext's own modules:

| What actually happened | Where ERPNext records it | Shift role |
|---|---|---|
| Fuel sold to customer | POS Invoice → GL Entry | Linked via `fms_shift` custom field |
| Fleet/credit fuel sale | Sales Invoice → AR → GL | Linked via `fms_shift` |
| Fuel delivered to tank | Purchase Receipt → Stock Ledger → GL | Linked via `fms_linked_shift` |
| Wetstock loss written off | Stock Reconciliation or Material Issue → GL | Linked via `fms_shift` |
| Cash moved to safe | Journal Entry (DR Safe / CR Till) | Linked via `fms_shift` |
| RTT correction | Stock Entry (Material Transfer) → Stock Ledger | Linked via `fms_shift` |

The Shift's job is to:
1. Define the accountability period (who, when, at which station)
2. Capture the physical meter readings and dip readings that allow us to **verify** what ERPNext's modules recorded
3. Group all the related ERPNext documents so you can navigate from a single Shift record to every invoice, stock entry, and journal entry it generated
4. Identify discrepancies between physical reality (meters, dips) and what the system recorded (invoices, stock entries)

**The reconciliation does not create the GL — it verifies it.** When the manager approves a Shift Reconciliation and a Journal Entry is posted, that JE is for the **variance** (wetstock loss, cash short/over) — not for the sales revenue, which was already posted when each POS Invoice was submitted during the shift.

### 23.2 Implications for Doctype Design

The `Shift Reconciliation → Product Summaries` child table does not store revenue. It reads from submitted POS Invoices and Sales Invoices linked to the shift. The `gross_revenue` field is a computed display field — not a ledger field.

The `Shift Reconciliation → Tank Wetstock Summaries` child table does not deduct stock. The stock was already deducted when the POS Invoices were submitted (if `Update Stock = Yes` on the POS Profile) or via an automated Stock Entry. The wetstock summary **compares** what the stock ledger says against what the physical dip says.

```
Shift is a lens, not a ledger.
```

### 23.3 What "Shift Close" Actually Posts

The only new accounting event at shift close is:

1. **Wetstock variance JE** — if physical dip differs from stock ledger by a material amount
2. **Cash variance JE** — if cashier's actual cash count differs from expected
3. **Safe drop JE** — cash moving from Till to Safe account

Everything else (revenue, COGS, stock deductions) was already posted in real time as each POS Invoice was submitted.

---

## 24. Corrected Data Flow — Standard ERPNext Integration

### 24.1 Price Management via ERPNext Price List

Do not use a separate `Fuel Price History` doctype to store the current pump price. Use ERPNext's native `Price List` and `Item Price` doctypes, which already handle this correctly.

**Setup:**

```
Price List name:  "Pump Prices — Shell Maanzoni"
Currency:         KES
Selling:          Yes
Buying:           No
Country:          Kenya
```

Create one `Item Price` record per fuel grade per site:

| Item Code | Price List | Rate | Valid From |
|---|---|---|---|
| FUEL-PMS-UNL | Pump Prices — Shell Maanzoni | 214.20 | 2026-05-01 |
| FUEL-PMS-VP | Pump Prices — Shell Maanzoni | 229.00 | 2026-05-01 |
| FUEL-AGO | Pump Prices — Shell Maanzoni | 242.90 | 2026-05-01 |

When the shift opens, it reads the current `Item Price` for each grade and locks it into `rate_pms_unl`, `rate_pms_vp`, `rate_ago`. From that point on, the shift is immune to mid-shift price changes — the locked rate is the one used for all validations.

The POS Profile is configured to use the site-specific price list, so prices auto-fill on POS Invoices without manual entry.

**Custom fields to add on Item Price** (via FMS fixtures):

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `fms_effective_shift` | Select | Current / Next Shift / Scheduled |
| `fms_scheduled_effective_at` | Datetime | When this price takes effect |
| `fms_pts_push_status` | Select | Pending / Pushed / Failed |
| `fms_approved_by` | Link → User | Required if rate > EPRA max |
| `fms_epra_max_price` | Currency | EPRA cap at time of this price |

### 24.2 Cashier as Employee with GL Account

Instead of a standalone Cashier doctype, use the ERPNext `Employee` record with custom fields. The key addition is linking the cashier to their physical till GL account.

**Custom fields on Employee** (via FMS fixtures):

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `fms_rfid_tag_id` | Data | RFID card ID for PTS-2 pump authorisation |
| `fms_pts_pin` | Password | Optional PIN for PTS authorisation |
| `fms_till_gl_account` | Link → Account | The till account this cashier is responsible for |
| `fms_default_station` | Link → Branch | Default station for this employee |
| `fms_is_cashier` | Check | Flags employee as a cashier for POS and session setup |
| `fms_is_supervisor` | Check | Can authorise cash events |

When a `Cashier Session` is created, it copies `fms_till_gl_account` from the Employee record. This is the account that is debited in the GL Journal Entry at shift close for this cashier's actual cash count.

This eliminates the need for a separate Cashier doctype and keeps all payroll, leave, and HR data consolidated on the Employee record.

### 24.3 Territory for HQ Regional Grouping

Use ERPNext's native `Territory` hierarchy to group stations for HQ reporting. This is already used by ERPNext's sales reports and needs no customisation.

```
All Territories
└── Kenya
    ├── Nairobi Region
    │   ├── Shell Maanzoni      ← Territory on Customer/Company
    │   ├── Shell Westlands
    │   └── Shell Thika Road
    ├── Coast Region
    │   └── Shell Mombasa Road
    └── Rift Valley Region
        └── ...
```

Set the `Territory` field on each sub-company's Company record. HQ reports automatically filter by Territory to give regional views without any custom code.

### 24.4 Stock Levels from ERPNext Stock Module

HQ does not need a custom stock dashboard. ERPNext's built-in reports are the source of truth:

| Report | Location | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| **Stock Balance** | Stock → Reports | Current litres per tank warehouse |
| **Stock Ledger** | Stock → Reports | Every movement: GRN in, sales out, adjustments |
| **Warehouse-wise Stock Balance** | Stock → Reports | Filter by warehouse group = all Maanzoni tanks |
| **Stock Summary** | Stock → Reports | By item group, filter `Fuel` |

For the HQ Dashboard, these are queried via Frappe's `frappe.db.sql()` or `frappe.get_report_doc()` — not recalculated from FMS doctypes.

---

## 25. Shift Auto-Open and Carry-Forward Logic

### 25.1 Shift Scheduling at the Station Level

The Shift Master (Forecourt Site Preferences) defines the shift schedule for each station:

**Add these fields to `Forecourt Site Preferences`:**

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shift_schedule_type` | Select | 24h / Multi-Shift | |
| `shift_start_time` | Time | 06:00 | For 24h stations: daily start time |
| `shift_duration_hours` | Int | 24 | For 24h stations |
| `shift_1_start` | Time | 06:00 | For multi-shift: Shift 1 start |
| `shift_1_label` | Data | Day | |
| `shift_2_start` | Time | 14:00 | Shift 2 start |
| `shift_2_label` | Data | Evening | |

### 25.2 Auto-Open Logic

When a shift is closed, if `auto_open_next_shift = True`, the system immediately creates the next shift and populates its opening meter readings from the closed shift's closing readings.

```python
# fms/api/shift_auto.py

### 25.3 Meter Reading Organisation on the Shift Form

Opening meter readings are displayed in a structured grid on the Shift form — grouped by pump and nozzle, with all three types side by side. Once submitted (carried forward or manually entered), they are **read-only**.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  OPENING METER READINGS (Read-Only after submission)              │
├──────────┬──────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Pump    │  Nozzle  │  Elec Vol (L)   Elec Cash (KES)  Man Mech│
├──────────┼──────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  UX5     │  2 (UX)  │  171,275,183  │  29,387,277  │  171,275,182│
│  UX6     │  2 (UX)  │  462,357.45   │  99,034,978  │  462,357.4 │
│  DX5     │  1 (DX)  │  55,065,556   │  15,918,476  │  55,065,556│
│  VP7     │  1 (VP)  │  9,884,632    │   2,263,540  │   9,884,632│
│  ...     │  ...     │  ...          │  ...         │  ...       │
└──────────┴──────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────┘

  CLOSING METER READINGS (Editable until shift closes)
  [Enter values here — system validates against opening]
```

The closing readings section is an editable mirror of the same structure. The system computes and displays the delta (Sold Ltrs, Sold KES, Var Ltrs) in real time as the supervisor types — exactly like the legacy screen's `VIEW THROUGHPUT AND SALES FOR FUEL PUMPS` section.

## 26. HQ Configuration Powers

### 26.1 What HQ Can Configure (Not Just Read)

HQ Manager has read access to all financial data across sub-companies. In addition, HQ Manager has **configuration rights** over sub-company settings — not to edit transactions, but to manage master data that drives how the sub-companies operate.

| Action | Where | Who |
|---|---|---|
| Set EPRA pump prices for any site | Item Price (with `fms_effective_shift`) | HQ Manager |
| Schedule bulk price change across all sites | Bulk Price Update Wizard | HQ Manager |
| Configure Forecourt Site Preferences for any site | Forecourt Site Preferences | HQ Manager |
| Create/edit Pump and Nozzle master data | Pump, Pump Nozzle | HQ Manager |
| Create/edit Tank Calibration Charts for any site | Tank Calibration Chart | HQ Manager |
| Add/deactivate employees for any site | Employee | HQ Manager |
| Set User Permissions for site staff | User Permissions | HQ Manager |
| View but NOT edit submitted transactions | All ERPNext doctypes | HQ Manager (read-only) |

This is enforced via ERPNext's Role Permission Manager:

```
HQ Manager role on Shift:         Read = 1,  Write = 0,  Submit = 0
HQ Manager role on Item Price:     Read = 1,  Write = 1,  Create = 1
HQ Manager role on Forecourt Site Preferences: Read = 1, Write = 1
HQ Manager role on POS Invoice:    Read = 1,  Write = 0
HQ Manager role on Journal Entry:  Read = 1,  Write = 0
```

### 26.2 Bulk Price Change with Scheduled Effective Shift

HQ Manager opens the Bulk Price Update Wizard (a custom Page in the FMS app):

1. Select fuel grades to update (checkboxes: UX, VP, DX, DPK)
2. Enter new prices for each grade
3. Select sites to apply to (checkboxes, Select All available)
4. Set effectiveness: `Immediately` or `Next Shift` (default) or `Scheduled: [datetime]`
5. Enter EPRA gazette reference
6. Click Apply

```python

### 28.3 Dashboard Definition (Frappe Dashboard Doctype)

Create this via `Setup → Dashboard → New Dashboard`:

```json
{
  "dashboard_name": "HQ Forecourt Dashboard",
  "charts": [
    {
      "chart": "Fuel Stock by Site",
      "width": "Half"
    },
    {

      "width": "Half"
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "chart": "Wetstock Variance Trend",
      "width": "Half"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each chart is a `Dashboard Chart` with `chart_type: Custom` pointing to the Python methods above.

### 28.4 Per-Territory Stock View

Territory is an ERPNext native concept. To group stock by region:

```python
@frappe.whitelist()
def get_stock_by_territory():
    """Group fuel stock by Territory for regional HQ view."""
    return frappe.db.sql("""
        SELECT

## 30. Corrections to Earlier Sections

The following architectural corrections apply to sections already documented. Any implementation team member should treat these as overrides.

### 30.1 Section 7.10 — Shift Reconciliation: Revenue Fields Are Read-Only Computed

The `gross_revenue` and `total_volume_l` fields in Shift Reconciliation's Product Summaries child table are **computed from POS Invoices and Sales Invoices**, not stored values. They are populated when "Compute Reconciliation" is clicked by querying:

```python
# Revenue comes from submitted invoices — not from meter readings
pos_totals = frappe.db.sql("""
    SELECT pii.item_code,
           SUM(pii.qty) AS qty_litres,
           SUM(pii.net_amount) AS revenue
    FROM `tabPOS Invoice` pi
    JOIN `tabPOS Invoice Item` pii ON pii.parent = pi.name
    WHERE pi.fms_shift = %(shift)s AND pi.docstatus = 1
    GROUP BY pii.item_code
""", {"shift": shift_name}, as_dict=True)
```

The meter readings provide the **physical verification** of these invoice totals. If Elec Cash (physical pump meter) diverges from POS Invoice totals (Check E), that is the signal that sales were dispensed but not invoiced.

### 30.2 Section 7.3 — Shift: No `total_net_volume` Fields

Remove the fields `total_net_volume_pms`, `total_net_volume_ago`, `total_net_volume_dpk`, and `total_gross_amount` from the Shift doctype. These are computed outputs of the Shift Reconciliation — they do not belong on the Shift master as stored fields.

The Shift doctype stores only **coordination data**: who, when, what station, what EPRA rates, and the status of the accountability period. The numbers live in ERPNext's modules.

### 30.3 Section 11.3 — Shift Close: GL Journal Only for Variances

The GL Journal posted at shift close covers only:
- Wetstock variance (DR Wetstock Variance / CR Fuel Inventory)
- Cash variance per cashier (DR or CR Cash Short/Over)
- Safe drop (DR Safe — Main / CR Till — Active)

Revenue, COGS, and stock deductions were already posted when each POS Invoice was submitted during the shift. Do not re-post them.

If the POS Profile has `Update Stock = Yes`, stock is depleted in real time per POS Invoice — no additional Stock Entry is needed at shift close. If `Update Stock = No`, a batch Stock Entry is created at shift close by the reconciliation engine.

### 30.4 Section 3 — Item Price Replaces Rate Fields on Shift

The fields `rate_pms_unl`, `rate_pms_vp`, `rate_ago`, `rate_dpk` on the Shift doctype are still valid — they serve as the locked snapshot of prices at shift open, preventing price-change contamination mid-shift. But they are **populated from ERPNext Item Price** (via `_get_current_price()` in Section 25.2) rather than from a custom FMS price doctype.
